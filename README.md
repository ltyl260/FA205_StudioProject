my vision is to have various ways to have webcam capture produce ducks, ideally like at teh tip of your fingers you are a fairy-duck-mother and sprinkle ducks everywhere you want.
It would be cool to be more like *Golan Levin* and have different motions or gestures create diferent ducks or tragectories of duck, or how big the ducks are but well see how progress goes.

trying to find differences between screenshot and live
## first issue: capturing the webcam ##
p5js version works but VSCodium only holds the upper right corner of the selection...
> issue was in the size of the capture, draw... needed to specify display size
> mostly in the mouse pressed function when getting the hold image through
> hold = capture.get(0, 0,capture.width,capture.height); needs to be adjusted to capture height...

** now that thats fixed.. I need to find the differences between the hold image and the live capture...*
## second issue: traversing the capture ##
from my test i have found that even with a pure black input the webcam values still fluctuate up to 11
> text(str(capture.pixels[20] + ' is ' + hold.pixels[20] +' = '+ (capture.pixels[idx] != hold.pixels[idx])), 30,30);
 so i will need to adjust my conditional brackest
from if ((capture.pixels[idx] != hold.pixels[idx])&&(capture.pixels[idx+1] != hold.pixels[idx+1])&&(capture.pixels[idx+2] != hold.pixels[idx+2])){
to if ((((hold.pixels[idx+0] - r) > capture.pixels[idx+0]) || (capture.pixels[idx+0] > hold.pixels[idx+0] + r))||(((hold.pixels[idx+1] - r) > capture.pixels[idx+1]) || (capture.pixels[idx+1] > hold.pixels[idx+1] + r))|| (((hold.pixels[idx+2] - r) > capture.pixels[idx+2]) || (capture.pixels[idx+2] > hold.pixels[idx+2] + r)))
> made variable range because +- 25 ended up being a more reasonable range from my test

## third issue: continuous capture NOT generated by mouseclicks ##
a wokring script for motion capture https://editor.p5js.org/bestesaylar/sketches/WFsPqG-8A by bestesaylar was helpful
and my issue was not knowing how to store the images which has been fixed by bestesaylars working sketch
## fourth step: ducks! ## 
instead of the motion showing up as red pixels id like to have ducks appear
this requires reusing my duck class and fitting it to this purpose. Initialising a duck will only require x and y positions, i am not worrying about a duck existing for longer than movement is detected at this stage they will just appear instead of the pixels, size will be set with the scalar just like the pixels are in the example
### duck issue 1: ducks arent appearing at desire x,y points ###
i have manually multiplied the x and y by factors of 4 - 
looks like the loops traverse the size of the capture and not the size of the screen, multiply by scaler to fix :)
